# Sneaky_Donkey
Sneaky donkey is an old buy-bot project I made for my dad who couldn't always be up at night to bid on ebay as a lot of people do to get the best price on an item.
Consequently I made this project, in python using Selenium !
## Whatitdo?
Sneaky donkey is a bot that will place the bid you specify on an item at the last second of the bid, you can have multiple placed bid at the same time and you can edit and delete items in the list as you see fit.

## Usage
To use your own sneaky donkey, simply execute the "Sneaky-donkey.py" file, you will need the pillow (https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) , Selenium (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and tkinter (https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/tkinter.html) packages

Hope you like yellow !
### Step 1:
Fill the "url" field with the url of the bid on ebay
### Step 2:
give it a meaningfull name and the price you want to bid at most
### Step 3:
enter your ebay login and password 
### Step 4:
hit "placer" (place) to put the bid in the list
### Step 5:
leave the software running, everything will be taken care of for you

## Disclamer:
The way the software works, it is very hard to future-proof it, this was only a project to test myself in python, I do not advise you use this software unless you test it first, ad it may not work (it will probably not work as this is not updated)
